# PEDESTAL

This is the code to reproduce the matrix sensing and matrix factorization experiments in the paper "Finding Local Minima Efficiently in Decentralized Optimization" in NeurIPS 2023.

## Matrix Sensing 
Go to the matrix sensing folder and run the command 
```
python matrix_sensing.py
```

## Matrix Factorization 
Go to the matrix factorization folder and run the command 

```
python matrix_factorization.py
```
